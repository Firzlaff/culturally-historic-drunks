We called ourselfs Cullturally Historic as we orginially wanted to include the Culture and History of each drink searhced. to do this we will use the WikiAPI and we plan to implement this. 
We also will be adding additional navigation abilties to go back to the top, or to be able to access the search from extra places within the application.
